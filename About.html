<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> Cricket</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom:50px;">Objective: The primary aim of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team. This is achieved by hitting the ball with a bat and running between two sets of wooden stumps, called wickets, situated at either end of the 22-yard-long pitch.

Playing Equipment:

Ball: A hard leather ball, usually red in Test cricket and white in limited-overs formats like One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches.
Bat: A flat, wooden bat used by batsmen to hit the ball.
Wickets: Three wooden stumps, topped by two bails, form a wicket. These are placed at each end of the pitch.
Protective Gear: Batsmen wear protective gear such as helmets, pads, gloves, and abdominal guards to prevent injury from the hard ball.
Playing Positions:

Batsmen: Two batsmen are on the field at any given time. Their primary job is to score runs.
Bowlers: Bowlers deliver the ball to the batsmen with the aim of getting them out or limiting the number of runs scored.
Fielders: The other players on the team are fielders. They aim to stop the ball and dismiss batsmen through catches, run-outs, or stumping.</p>
